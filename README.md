This is my first project after taking the HTML & CSS and Javascript courses on Codecademy.com.  
I got the Rock Paper Scissors idea from Codecademy, 
  but I wanted to make it have buttons instead of being text-based.
I'm not really sure how all this Github magic works but if someone is able to find this, 
  feel free to improve it.
